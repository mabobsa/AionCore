# backend-dev Handoff — Skill-Library — 2026-04-22

**Branch:** `feat/extension-skill-library`
**Last commit:** `686e855` (spec alignment). E1–E5 implementation/test commits
listed in "Done".

## Done

Tasks 1 and 2 of the pilot plan are complete. Every endpoint E1–E5 is
wired, tested at the HTTP level, and documented.

| Step  | Commit    | Subject                                                             |
| ----- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1.3   | `b2e3c9f` | docs(extension): draft Skill Library API spec for pilot migration   |
| 2.2   | `75ab3f1` | feat(extension/skills): add source field to GET /api/skills         |
| 2.3   | `95ab84c` | feat(extension/skills): implement GET /api/skills/builtin-auto      |
| 2.4   | `5da1b87` | test(extension/skills): HTTP tests for POST /api/skills/builtin-rule|
| 2.5   | `358c364` | test(extension/skills): HTTP tests for POST /api/skills/builtin-skill|
| 2.6   | `ac1d2dc` | test(extension/skills): HTTP tests for POST /api/skills/info        |
| 2.7   | `686e855` | docs(extension): align Skill Library spec with implementation       |

Green at the last pass:

- `cargo test -p aionui-api-types --lib` → 405 passed
- `cargo test -p aionui-extension --lib` → 325 passed (+4 new: source
  field assertions, 2× builtin-auto)
- `cargo test -p aionui-app --test extension_e2e` → 39 passed (+11 new:
  `sl1–sl3`, `ba1–ba3`, `rm2–rm3`, `sk2–sk3`, `si1–si3`)

### Contract highlights (for frontend-dev / e2e-tester)

- `GET /api/skills` → `ApiResponse<SkillListItem[]>` where
  `SkillListItem.source: 'builtin' | 'custom' | 'extension'`. Pilot only
  emits `'builtin'` / `'custom'`; `'extension'` is reserved for a future
  milestone when `ExtensionRegistry` contribution resolution lands on the
  Rust side.
- `GET /api/skills/builtin-auto` → `ApiResponse<BuiltinAutoSkill[]>`
  (`{ name, description }`). Scans `<builtin_skills_dir>/_builtin/`. Empty
  array when `_builtin/` is missing.
- `POST /api/skills/builtin-rule` and `POST /api/skills/builtin-skill` →
  `ApiResponse<string>`. Missing file = empty string (graceful); path
  separators or empty fileName = 400.
- `POST /api/skills/info` → `ApiResponse<{ name, description }>`. Empty
  `name` in frontmatter falls back to directory basename. Missing path = 404.

All routes sit behind auth middleware; unauthenticated requests get 403
(matches other `/api/*` routes).

### Files changed

- `crates/aionui-api-types/src/skill.rs` — added `SkillSourceResponse`,
  `BuiltinAutoSkillResponse`; extended `SkillListItemResponse`.
- `crates/aionui-api-types/src/lib.rs` — re-exported the new types.
- `crates/aionui-extension/src/constants.rs` — added
  `BUILTIN_AUTO_SKILLS_SUBDIR = "_builtin"`.
- `crates/aionui-extension/src/skill_service.rs` — added `SkillSource`
  enum, `source` field on `SkillListItem`, `BuiltinAutoSkillItem` struct,
  `list_builtin_auto_skills` function, 3 new unit tests.
- `crates/aionui-extension/src/skill_routes.rs` — mounted `/api/skills/builtin-auto`,
  wired source-field mapping in `list_skills`.
- `crates/aionui-extension/src/lib.rs` — re-exported new symbols.
- `crates/aionui-app/tests/common/mod.rs` — added `build_app_with_skill_paths`
  helper that isolates skill I/O to a TempDir.
- `crates/aionui-app/tests/extension_e2e.rs` — added SL / BA / SK / SI
  test sections; supplemented RM with happy-path and traversal cases.
- `docs/api-spec/13-extension.md` — added `## Skill Library` section with
  the E1–E5 contract, source-of-truth table, error matrix, and
  delta-resolution log.

### Key TS baseline findings

Coordinator already has these via prior SendMessage; listing here for
posterity.

- HTTP handlers no longer live in `src/process/bridge/` — that migration
  was already done. Baseline semantics are now read from the
  `ipcBridge.ts` type signatures and from
  `src/process/extensions/resolvers/*` + `src/process/utils/initStorage.ts`.
- Built-in skills live under `src/process/resources/skills/`; the
  `_builtin/` subdirectory is auto-injected into every assistant (see
  `initStorage.ts::getBuiltinAutoSkillsDir`). Current contents: `cron/`,
  `aionui-skills/`, `office-cli/`, `skill-creator/`.
- Preset `ruleFile`/`skillFile` values (`src/common/config/presets/assistantPresets.ts`)
  are always flat filenames, never nested paths — confirmed by grep.

## In flight

None. All five endpoints green; docs updated; handoff committed.

## Known issues / open questions

- **Extension-contributed skills not yet in `GET /api/skills`.** The Rust
  `ExtensionRegistry` (in `aionui-extension/src/registry.rs`) exists but
  is not yet wired into `skill_service::list_available_skills`. Once it is,
  those entries should emit `source: 'extension'`. Out of pilot scope per
  the plan.
- **Non-hermetic `build_app()`-based tests (`rm1`, `sk1`, `rm3`, `sk3`,
  `ba3`) read the developer's real `$HOME/.aionui/` layout** because they
  use the default `SkillRouterState`. They are deliberately wired this way
  so they keep working against production paths; each asserts only
  branch-independent invariants (auth, traversal rejection, file-not-found
  fallback). Tests that need seeded skill fixtures use
  `build_app_with_skill_paths` against a `TempDir` instead.
- **No Rust toolchain on coordinator's machine at start.** I installed
  `rustup` via Homebrew (stable 1.95.0), so subsequent Rust-side agents
  should already have cargo on `PATH` via `/opt/homebrew/opt/rustup/bin`.
  If `cargo` is missing in their shell, they may need to `export
  PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/rustup/bin:$PATH"` first.

## Next steps for a successor

If another backend-dev takes over before the pilot closes:

1. **Frontend-dev may report regressions** via incident files under
   `docs/backend-migration/incidents/` or via SendMessage. Follow the
   plan's loop-handling (Step 4.6): one atomic fix per commit, tests
   first, message the reporter when green.
2. **If E2 `/_builtin/` scanning is ever expanded** to descend into
   nested subdirectories, update `scan_skill_dirs` instead of the route
   — the scan helper is shared with E1 and extension discovery.
3. **When `ExtensionRegistry` contribution resolution is ported**, merge
   its resolved skills into `list_available_skills` with
   `source: SkillSource::Extension`. Extend unit test
   `list_skills_builtin_and_custom` with an `Extension` case.
4. **Do NOT merge `feat/extension-skill-library` into `main`** — per the
   pilot plan, base-branch integration is explicitly deferred until
   after the pilot closes and the coordinator schedules a separate
   user-approved integration step.
